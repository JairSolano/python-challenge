Module 3 Challenge
A great exercise of knowing what to look for in the data after sorting.
Found myself having to take a break after finding the first round of numbers, such as totals, to come up with a game plan of what data I need from the file to get my desired results.
I was challenged with the path as I had to open multiple files, I can now say I have a good grasp of path.

A few for loops and if statements. 

Thank you
